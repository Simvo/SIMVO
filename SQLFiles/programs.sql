Courses on the technical operations and economics of the process industries are added to this foundation. The core curriculum concludes with process design courses taught by practising design engineers. Problem-solving, experimenting, planning, and communication skills are emphasized in courses throughout the core curriculum.Certain students who take advantage of Summer session courses can complete the departmental program in three calendar years.

Here are some benefits of the concentration:A complete and up-to-date final-year program in electrical power engineering, with industry-sponsored and supported coursesAccess to industry-sponsored projects, internships, and new employment opportunitiesELIGIBILITY CRITERIATo be considered in September 2017, the applicant must:- be registered in the B.Eng. program (regular Electrical Engineering);- have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.5;- have completed or be registered in ECSE 361 (Power Engineering);- be able to complete the degree requirements by December 2018;- agree to follow the curriculum requirements set out below.SELECTION CRITERIAThe number of students selected, expected to be between five and ten, will be subject to a specific agreement between the University and the Institute. Selection criteria for admission to the Institute will be based on the CGPA and on the curriculum vitae. The selection process for the scholarship may involve an interview with the committee presided by Hydro-Qubec and the industrial partners. There is a possibility of an internship with Hydro-Qubec.CURRICULUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SELECTED STUDENTSGenerally, unless the University has authorized specific substitutions, students must complete the degree requirements set out in this eCalendar with the following specifications:',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'EN','EN','BENG','Bachelor of Engineering',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0156,'Electrical & Computer Engr',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-12-09 22:17:08');
