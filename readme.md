I am still trying to configure travis so I will test all pull requests manually and ignore the status

# S!MVO Degree Planner

The Degree Planner is an open source web appplication allowing students to organize and interact with their degrees with a friendly user interface.

The app uses the Laravel web framework along with JQuery in the front end. If you are unfamiliar with frameworks, I suggest looking at laracast's demo: https://laracasts.com/series/build-your-first-app-in-laravel.

## Contributing

### Bug Fixes and Reports

Thank you for considering contributing to the Degree Planner!

We prefer bug reports to be done through pull requests. If you discover a bug on the latest build, branch off dev and give it a name representing the behaviour of the error. Then, make a pull request (with no code at first) with a more detailed explanantion and screenshots/videos showing the bug. This allows us to easily test the fix by simply checking out the remote branch.

### General Contribution

If you would like to add a new feature or improvement please make a report in the issues tab in github. When you make a request, be ready to start coding the feature yourself.

### Which Branch?

It is simple, everything goes on dev. Any PR to master will be rejected promptly. Our workflow makes it so the master branch is copied directly to the server. Just to be clear again, branch off dev and compare with dev!


## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within the degree planner, please send an e-mail to Thomas Karatzas at thomas.karatzas@simvo.io. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
